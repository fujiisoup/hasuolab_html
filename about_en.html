<h1>About Optical Engineering Laboratory</h1>

<h2>Meetings in our Lab.</h2>

<p>
<b>(1) Laboratory Meetings (weekly)</b><br>
All the members meet together, and inform and discuss business schedules and items with each other.
</p>

<p>
<b>(2) Research Report Meeting（weekly）</b><br>
Students report recent progress and problems in their research activities.
Following a report, all the members discuss together the direction of the research and the way to overcome the problems.
Report and discussion time is about 30 minutes per student.
Through the meeting, students are expected to learn and acquire the scientific presentation techniques and problem-solving skills and to share the scientific knowledge.
Since each student has to report once in two weeks at least, students have to manage their own research schedules.
</p>

<p>
<b>(3) Journal Report Meeting (weekly)</b><br>
After the research report meeting, a graduate student or a teaching staff introduces a recent scientific paper as if he or she is one of the authors.
Through the objective, logical and critical discussion on the facts reported in the paper, students are expected to learn the way of scientific thinking.
</p>

<p>
<b>(4) Seminar for undergraduate students (weekly)</b><br>
4th year undergraduate students read a English textbook of elementary spectroscopy to study the basic knowledge of atomic physics and spectroscopy and the reading skill of scientific English.
</p>
<br>

<h2>How to proceed with bachelor thesis research</h2>
<p>
Brief overview of the research topics and experimental apparatus in the laboratory are introduced to 4th year undergraduate students.
Research themes for the bachelor theses are determined through discussion between students and teaching staffs.
If students have any hope about the themes, we respect it.
Every theme is NOT a part of theses of graduate students.
<br>
After the decision, the students acquire the basic skills with support from tutor graduated students, and then proceed with their research on their own initiative. Of course, the teaching staffs lead the students to acquire the scientific way of thinking and advise them when the students have problems.
<br>
The students can feel free to make discussions in our Lab and graduate students are very kind. Usually, all the students finish their bachelor theses with a sense of achievement.
</p>

<h2>How to proceed with master thesis research</h2>
<p>
From discussion with teaching staffs, master course students determine their research themes involving light or plasmas to investigate unknown phenomena, unexplored techniques, or concepts which break conventions.
<br>
To proceed with the research, especially to challenge something new in research, accumulation and acquisition of relevant knowledge and techniques are necessary. We demand the students to consult such knowledge and techniques and to practice them actively. We also require the students to make proposal of their own ideas and explain the problems to be overcame. Through scientific discussion with teaching staffs, the students are expected to learn and acquire the scientific attitude toward experimental and calculated results and to perform self-sustaining research activities. Acquisition of instruction ability is also expected from tutorship to undergraduate students.
<br>
We encourage the students to report their achievement in a scientific journal and/or an international conference as well as in a domestic conference with the support by staffs.
<br></p>

<h2>How to proceed with PhD thesis research</h2>
<p>
The teaching staffs lead PhD students to perform their research theme by their own ability with enhancing the research environment. Interactions with domestic and foreign researchers are strongly encouraged and the staffs support them to proceed smoothly.
<br></p>

<h2>We hope students having rich curiosity</h2>
<p>
Driving force of research is scientific curiosity of humans. We, however, understand that in the beginning of the research life, you have deficient knowledge and feel difficult to have great curiosity. But we also know that, in your step by step research progress, you become able to do something not previously possible and become aware of new facts, and then curiosity grows in your mind. The curiosity makes you to get further knowledge and techniques, and leads you another curiosity. We hope to see students having rich curiosity.
