While knowing plasma parameters in fusion devices is essential, it is still very helpful to know what happens to the molecules of the main fuel - hydrogen. This information is helpful to develop a wholesome model of hydrogen fuel cycle in the device. In our group, we studied exactly that. We’ve investigated the peripheral plasma of LHD and measured rotational and vibrational population distribution for H2 and D2 in the excited state and deduced the population distributions of the ground state molecules.

<h2 id="micro_plasma">Ion Flow Measurement in Fusion Plasma using Emission Spectroscopy
</h2>

<h3>Fig. (a) Schematics of experimental setup for the flow measurements. Light emitted from the plasmas were measured by several lines of sight (the blue lines) and optical fibers bundles and lenses. (b) Example of C III emission spectra. Emission from C2+ impurity ions was measured. The  measured spectrum (shown in black marker) has a peak shifted to the  shorter wavelength side than rest wavelength (shown in red vertical line). (c) Measured distribution of velocity under different magnetic conditions with different heating conditions [1].

Fusion power generation, which utilizes the energy of nuclear fusion reaction, is expected to be an alternative energy resource. For its realization, a hydrogen plasma with high temperature needs to be confined using a magnetic field. In order to  reveal the driving and damping mechanism of the flow in the plasma, which has been known to improve the confinement, we have developed a spectroscopic method based on the ion Doppler effect.
<br>
Ions in plasma emit light with the wavelength unique to the species. Additionally, when ions have a finite velocity along the observation direction, the observed wavelength of this light is shifted because of the Doppler effect. We have developed a method to measure this Doppler shift precisely with the accuracy of several km/s.
<br>
The experiment was performed in QUEST (Q-shu University Experiment with Steady-State Spherical Tokamak) in Kyushu Univ.

<h2 id="micro_plasma">Statistical modeling of Atoms and Plasmas
</h2>
<center><img src="research_img/nuclei_atom.png" width="300">

</center>
<p>
Interacting many-body systems, such as electrons in heavy atoms and charged particles in plasmas, often exhibit very complex behaviors. We study their statistical model, where we try to approximate the complex parts based on probability theory to extract essential properties of the systems.
<br>
For example, it has been known for a long time that the number of emission lines with a given intensity from complex many-electron atoms follow a power-law. Based on a simple probabilistic modeling, we theoretically explained this property for the first time. Furthermore, we showed that electromagnetic emissions from one of similar systems, heavy nuclei, also follow the same distribution.
<br>
Such power-law distributions have been often observed in many fields of natural and social sciences. In particular, the power-law distribution is considered to be related to the scale-free nature of systems. We pointed out that the power-law intensity distribution, which we found above, originated from the fact that the atomic structure and the nuclear structure have a property of a scale-free network.

<h2 id="micro_plasma">Development of an all-optical diamond temperature sensor</h2>
<center><img src="research_img/diamond_sensor.jpg" width="600">
<br clear="left">
</center>
<p>
Diamond has a large thermal conductivity and is used for window materials, heat sinks, and temperature sensors. In this study, we are developing a novel sensor that can measure temperature using only light. We are investigating the temperature dependence of the photoluminescence spectrum (left figure) using diamond particles containing point defects called color centers. By combining the sensor with an endoscope using a multimode optical waveguide (right figure), we are applying the sensor to measurements in narrow spaces such as inside the sample holder of an analyzer.
